This project aims to explore and visualize information related to high schools in NYC.
Through this analysis, we hope to answer the following questions:

1. How do the demographics differ across different neighborhoods?
2. How do the demographics differ in schools of different neighborhoods? Is there a difference from the neighborhoods demographics?
3. Are there certain patterns among schools that share similar features?
*(4. How does this realte to high school performances?) maybe*
