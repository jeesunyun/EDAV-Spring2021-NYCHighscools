# Introduction

This project aims to explore and visualize information related to high schools in NYC.
Through this analysis, we hope to answer the following questions:

1. What does the distribution of schools look like in a map? In terms of number of schools and students; different types of schools,etc.
2. How do the demographics differ across different schools? How do the demographics differ in schools of different neighborhoods?
3. How are schools among different boroughs distinct in terms of variety of programs/courses available?
