# Introduction

This project aims to explore and visualize information related to high schools in NYC.
Through this analysis, we hope to answer the following questions:

1. How do the demographics differ across different neighborhoods?
2. How do the demographics differ in schools of different neighborhoods? Is there a difference from the neighborhoods demographics?
3. Are there certain shared characteristics among schools?
