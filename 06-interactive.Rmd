# Interactive component


Select one (or more) of your key findings to present in an interactive or animated format using D3 version 6. Be thoughtful about how you use interactivity and/or animation: using these features to add value in a way that would not be possible with a static graph.

Design with the goal of users walking away with a new understanding of the data and a clear understanding of the purpose of the visualization. If the tool is interactive, provide clear instructions on how the user should engage. Thoughtfulness  is more important than technical prowess; in all aspects of the project, think quality, not quantity.

Interactive graphs must follow all of the best practices as with static graphs in terms of perception, labeling, accuracy, etc.

Please see  this chapter on sharing your D3 code online (Links to an external site.)  for options for sharing the interactive portion of your project. You are encouraged to share experiences on  Piazza (Links to an external site.)  to help classmates with the publishing process.

Note: the interactive component is worth approximately 25% of the final project grade. Therefore, do not spend 90% of your time on itâ€¦ concentrate on the exploratory data analysis piece.
