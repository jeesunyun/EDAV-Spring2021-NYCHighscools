Over 1.1 million students are taught across 1,800 schools. This project aims to explore and visualize some of the information related to the various schools throughout NYC – with a slight focus on high schools. Through this analysis, we hoped to gain some insight on the following questions: What does the distribution of schools look like in a map? In terms of number of schools and students; different types of schools,etc. How do the demographics differ across different schools? How do the demographics differ in schools of different neighborhoods? How are schools among different boroughs distinct in terms of variety of programs/courses available? Is there some kind of discrepancy between the experienced diversity of high school students and the reality of the diversity in these schools?

Since we are exploring education data, most of the data are provided by the Department of Education. Below are the lists of datasets that we utilized. Doing joins of these data by school names, we will be able to get a comprehensive look at highschools and neighborhoods. 2019-20 Demographic Snapshot (DOE) This gives us the demographics of all NYC schools. 2019 High school Directory (DOE) 2020 High school Directory (DOE) This helps us to understand the characteristics of each of the NYC high schools (whether they are zoned, specialized, program descriptions, etc.) Below are some references we took into account for this project. nycgeo package documentation EDA and Models with NYC Census Data The data collection work is completed in basis of an group effort of 3 to ensure the integrity and the accountability of the data we use. The datasets are downloaded from official governmental or government-related organizations. The main datasets we use came from NYC Open Data that stores all New York related datasets. It is one of the NYC.gov sites which is maintained officially through New York City government. 2.1 Dataset information The examples of the datasets are provided below, displayed using the head() function. The pieces of datasets presented in this project do not project the entire dataset, but are mostly the first 5-6 rows, and 5 columns due to vast numbers of columns. 2.1.1 School demographics and high school directory data ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## DBN `School Name` Year `Total Enrollmen… `Grade 3K+PK (Half Day &amp; … ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2015-… 176 14 ## 2 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2016-… 178 17 ## 3 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2017-… 190 17 ## 4 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2018-… 174 13 ## 5 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2019-… 190 14 ## 6 01M019 P.S. 019 Asher Levy 2015-… 270 21 ## [1] &quot;This dataframe of high school demographics data included 9096 rows of info and 39 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;The total number of missing data is 0 0 % of the total.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Below are the first 6 columns names of the data, this includes the categories of the datas recorded:&quot; ## [1] &quot;DBN&quot; &quot;School Name&quot; ## [3] &quot;Year&quot; &quot;Total Enrollment&quot; ## [5] &quot;Grade 3K+PK (Half Day &amp; Full Day)&quot; &quot;Grade K&quot; ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## dbn school_name boro overview_paragraph school_10th_sea… ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 16K498 Brooklyn High Schoo… K The mission of Brooklyn Hi… Y ## 2 17K524 International High … K We are a small school that… Y ## 3 02M531 Repertory Company H… M We offer a college-prepara… Y ## 4 05M670 Thurgood Marshall A… M Thurgood Marshall Academy … Y ## 5 15K423 Brooklyn Frontiers … K Brooklyn Frontiers High Sc… &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 03M291 West End Secondary … M We promote and support sch… &lt;NA&gt; ## [1] &quot;This dataframe of high school demographics data included 427 rows of info and 462 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;The total number of missing data is 160305 , 81.26 % of the total.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Below are the first 6 columns names of the data, this includes the categories of the datas recorded:&quot; ## [1] &quot;dbn&quot; &quot;school_name&quot; &quot;boro&quot; ## [4] &quot;overview_paragraph&quot; &quot;school_10th_seats&quot; &quot;academicopportunities1&quot; The demographics data includes data related to grades, race and ethnicity, disabilities, and economic status.

NTA codes are GIS information for geographic marks and locations in NYC. Every single NTA code will match a place mark. For some information like Census codes, the R uses incorrect scientific notation, so we got rid of it. ## # A tibble: 2,167 x 5 ## CensusTract County Borough TotalPop Men ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 36005000100 Bronx Bronx 7703 7133 ## 2 36005000200 Bronx Bronx 5403 2659 ## 3 36005000400 Bronx Bronx 5915 2896 ## 4 36005001600 Bronx Bronx 5879 2558 ## 5 36005001900 Bronx Bronx 2591 1206 ## 6 36005002000 Bronx Bronx 8516 3301 ## 7 36005002300 Bronx Bronx 4774 2130 ## 8 36005002400 Bronx Bronx 150 109 ## 9 36005002500 Bronx Bronx 5355 2338 ## 10 36005002701 Bronx Bronx 3016 1375 ## # … with 2,157 more rows This datasets has recorded the census tract information, its borough identity, total population and ethnicity info. Before we start our research and investigation. We need to clean up the datasets. As we have read the description from NYCdata.gov and this datasets is downloaded from the government website, the integrity of the data is assured, what we need to do is to drop the non-registered values in the datasets. Why there are NA values inside this governmental dataset? It is because the collection technique of the data, with the variables it contains, cannot apply to all of the tracts(the unit of census measurement). When census is being conducted in certain tracts, the data collector will collect the data with their own discretion on how these criterias applies to their tract. 2.2 Problems with NYC datasets health and census data. All datasets from NYC governmental background follow a certain pattern: they have a series of certain columns with identification information including NTA codes(Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA)), tracks ids, etc. The arrangements of these columns also have a hierarchical structure: starting from bits of tracts to all of the 5 boroughs. These structural datasets greatly benefited our project. NTA codes column in many of these datasets means that we can join different datasets together and conduct the combined research towards of topics. Its relation with GIS spatial information also assisted our visualization part. Thus with the completion of our project, we would like to thank NYC government who did all of these dedicated work and share them for education and public policy making purposes. However, data related to schools, such as graduation rate or performance data can be easily found to be not available, mainly because they are not mandatory to be reported. Also, a lot of the data are not quantitative, but include free text forms of descriptions, which are not easy to work with. Also, NYC datasets is not very easy to use and understand. The researchers must investigate and read the description on how to interpret the information inside the datasets like NTA codes, track ids, longitude and latitude. There are many N/As inside the datasets which indicated some degree of incomplete of the raw data collection. From a programming perspective, the NYC datasets are not very suitable for R: the packages to process GIS information and spatial data require the researcher to read those detailed docs for specific packages like nycgeo.

Then, create new columns that contain population counts for high school grades and non-highschool grades. Here, we set for high school to be from grades 9 to 12, according to New York city Department of Education description. It is given that students in their 8th grade apply to high schools. We assume that schools that have grades 6 to 12, or K to 12, etc. have continuing students. Also, the dataset consists of information ranging from school years 2015 to 2019. We want to filter out years other than 2019 for initial processing of the data since the directory data are for 2019-2020. Moreover, we created new columns hs_enroll and non_hs to divide population that are in grades 9 to 12 to others. ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## DBN School_Name Year Total_Enrollment hs_enroll ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M292 Orchard Collegiate Academy 2019-… 226 226 ## 2 01M448 University Neighborhood High School 2019-… 492 492 ## 3 01M450 East Side Community School 2019-… 680 364 ## 4 01M458 Forsyth Satellite Academy 2019-… 181 181 ## 5 01M509 Marta Valle High School 2019-… 97 97 ## 6 01M515 Lower East Side Preparatory High Sch… 2019-… 531 531 3.1.2 High school directory data Dimension of the directory data: ## [1] 427 462 The directory data has very extensive information each schools, from basic school information to detailed descriptions of each program and admission information.

Number of observations with different reported population: ## [1] 420 66 Number of observations with identical reported population: ## [1] 5 66 Only 5 schools have total number of students identical in both data sets. Investigating the data, we see that there are population data missing for 2 schools from the Demographics dataset. Column Total_Enrollment comes from Demographics data, and total_students come from Directory data.

We can see that these two schools share that they do not serve grades until 12th grade. According to the aforementioned NYC high school description (grade 9 to 12), we can filter out these schools. Also, since the demographic data are from the Demographics dataset, we recalculate the other values into proportion with the demographics total population. Take out the total_students column and the School_Name column, since two dataframes were joined by dbn and the school names are written differently.

Why we need a boundries map before we get into our business? The census data, along with our other datasets, contains longitudes and latitude data, including the NTA codes with geospatial information. We need to create a tile map, a base map for us to plot our data on first. Once this tile map is created, we can plot our points and generate approperiate visualizations. NYC Census Data Examples - NYC residents College degree census To confirm that the map boundary that we created above works, we implemented an example map that shows the percentage of people that has a Bachelor’s degree and above in NYC. We can see that the area that has the most university graduates are in Manhattan, especially up to what appears to be Morningside Heights, and in Brooklym close to Manhattan. Such an example demonstration of New York census data and what kind of information it recorded, is widely used in investigating child poverty of New York. 5.2 Explore characteristics shared by schools Grades in schools ## ## 6 to 12 7 to 12 9 to 12 9 to 14 K to 12 ## [1,] 74 1 335 7 4 ## ## School is structured on credit needs, not grade level ## [1,] 4 The table shows that schools are mostly from grades 9 to 12, and 6 to 12. We want to see characteristics of these schools, especially in what classes and diploma are offered. We separate the columns of such columns by &quot;,&quot; since they are currently in a free text form and change them to categories. 5.2.1 Courses and Programs Available language classes according to borough The order of language classes in the x-axis are ordered by their total frequency. Thus, Spanish is the most taught foreign language in high schools, followed by French, Italian, and Mandarin. However, it is difficult to see in the above graph which borough offers the most language classes, so we create a treemap to observe. AP courses available by borough The order of the x-axis shows the most offered AP courses, insinuating a certain popularity of such AP courses in high schools. In accordance to the language courses, Staten Island has the least schools and thus the least variety of courses offered. 5.2.2 Demographics Demographics of high school students in New York in a whole Population of students and number of schools per neighborhood Largely, the number of students that go to school in a certain area seem sto be in proportion to the number of schools in the corresponding neighborhood. However, in certain neighborhood in Queens and in Lower Manhattan seems to have outliers, where there are more students than surrounding neighborhoods that have more schools. So, we would like to see how many schools there are per 100 students. Here in this graph, the higher the ratio would indicate that there are more schools per number of students, where as the darker areas indicate that there are fewer schools per students than other neighborhoods. Student demographics by borough Although the number of students per borough are significantly different, it is suaprising that the proportion of students of a certain race among big boroughs like Brooklyn and Manhattan are similar. 5.3 Different Categories of schools in NYC Find all categories of the schools in NYC. ## [1] &quot;Charter School&quot; ## [2] &quot;Elementary School&quot; ## [3] &quot;Intermediate School&quot; ## [4] &quot;Academic High School&quot; ## [5] &quot;High school - Public&quot; ## [6] &quot;Special Education School&quot; ## [7] &quot;Junior High-Intermediate-Middle School - Public&quot; ## [8] &quot;Elementary School - Public&quot; ## [9] &quot;K-8 School - Charter&quot; ## [10] &quot;K-8 School - Public&quot; ## [11] &quot;Secondary School - Public&quot; ## [12] &quot;Elementary School - Charter&quot; ## [13] &quot;K-12 all grades School - Charter&quot; ## [14] &quot;Junior High-Intermediate-Middle School - Charter&quot; ## [15] &quot;High school - Charter&quot; ## [16] &quot;K-12 all grades School - Public&quot; ## [17] &quot;School&quot; ## [18] &quot;Secondary School - Charter&quot; ## [19] &quot;Vocational High School&quot; ## [20] &quot;Educational Skills Center&quot; ## [21] &quot;Alternative High School&quot; ## [22] &quot;Public School&quot; We have create an overview histogram that showed how many, and what kind of the schools NYC has in total. All of the school are carefully labeled. From the histogram, we can see that the Public schools are clearly the majority of the educational institutions, follow by charter schools, which are run under private board and custom agendas(part of them are private and for-profit). The histogram showed the popularity of public institution in K-12 system in NYC. In the dataset we have noticed that there could be a fine line between high school institution and non-high-school institutions among all of these different names of categories. And this line became our boundries of investigations. Our questions below has been divided between high school and non-high-school scenarios. As seen previously in the data cleaning process, high schools are not strictly from grades 9 to 12 but there are also schools from grade 6 to 12, or K to 12(all grades) schools. Thus, it would be inefficient and ineffective to plot something like below, only showing for highschools: 5.3.1 Geo-spatitial Interactive Map of NYC school datasets We read in the New York School Data, which recorded name, type, and location information for all New York schools for people under 18. We use ggmap package to create this interactive map and use Google Map API to map the geospatial data to the map. This interactive map have multiple styles of base map. Each plot point represents a school, zoom in will reaveal more details: if click on the point, it will show the information of the school: name, categories of the school and its id. It’s not hard for us to find out the general distribution of the schools are concentrating on the north of Manhattan island and middle of Brooklyn. Except these 2 hot zones, the other part of the NYC has their schools scattered. 5.3.2 Investigating the school locations. The charter schools are schools that do not charge fees to student who take state exams. Compare to public schools, they receive less funding but have more autonomy in the administration of education. From the plot, we can see the charter schools(in red dots), which are designed to compete with public schools, are much fewer compared to purple dots. This showed in the elementary to middle school level, people trust NYC public schools in general. The distribution of the publics schools among all NYC tracts could also be considered equal: they are not visibly over-crowded in one or more specific areas. This provided the evidence that the public schools from elementary levels are well supported by NYC education branch of the government funding. 5.3.3 Maps high schools In the high school level, we witnessed that the amount of the charter schools and the public schools are almost equal. One reason behind this is that Charter school in High school level can recruit more students compare to Elementary level, which provided more fundings to the Charter school. This allows Charter school to enhance its performance. The other reason is that compare to elementary public schools, public high school receive less fundings from the NYC government. This, even though didn’t suggest that Charter high school are necessarily better than public high schools, but its indication revealed that we should invest more on public high school education. 5.3.4 Graph of the vocational high school ## NULL Vocational high school, alternative high school and educational skills center are vocation-purpose institutions. It aims at providing another option for educating middle students to a specific profession and introduce them to the job market. Vocational training institutions are assisting to the college system and beneficial to the whole society. In this graph, we see there are not many such institutions in NYC city. Could this be a direction of public support? In Germany both such institutions are well-funded and it helped greatly to the job market and lowers the unemployment rate. 5.3.5 Intermediate schools ## NULL Another interesting question we would like to investigate is the Intermediate school option. Intermediate schools are the schools for students in Grade 7-8, which equals to middle school level. Intermediate schools provided another option for students who graduated from elementary school level (over 6-grades) but not in a K-8 or K-12 school. The reason why we are investigating this is to see how many parents will decide to opt-out of the middle-high school system and reallocate their kids to another school specifically. The Intermediate schools, along with Junior high schools, are popular options in NYC. The graph showed a relatively balanced numbers of Intermediate schools and non-intermediate schools. 5.3.6 Special education school mapping ## uid facname factype latitude ## 15 8671 PS 34 Special Education School 40.85028 ## 115 22605 PS 25 &amp; PS 4 Portable Special Education School 40.53969 ## 187 136781 PS 148 Special Education School 40.78633 ## 333 47522 PS 177 &amp; Playground Special Education School 40.74327 ## 340 167497 PS 58 Special Education School 40.76416 ## 411 124528 PS 811 (Old PS 187-Cmhc)&amp;Plygd Special Education School 40.75646 ## 561 87078 PS 77 Special Education School 40.67873 ## 723 193182 PS 369 Special Education School 40.68733 ## 817 75115 PS 148 Special Education School 40.69925 ## 832 83564 Special Education School Special Education School 40.81658 ## 852 122213 PS 371 Special Education School 40.65417 ## 1016 164809 PS 186 Special Education School 40.83140 ## 1148 86898 PS 753 (Old Sterling HS) Special Education School 40.68263 ## 1361 115499 IS 24 Annex Special Education School 40.56403 ## 1616 97115 PS 9 (Old PS 86) Special Education School 40.71831 ## 1704 119297 PS 751 (Old PS 25) Special Education School 40.72572 ## 1724 149828 PS 721 Ax Otc Special Education School 40.84273 ## 1734 122158 PS 226-Special Education Special Education School 40.73477 ## 1749 69845 PS 75 Special Education School 40.69865 ## 1784 122535 Jhs 47 Annex Special Education School 40.73700 ## 1798 136789 PS 169 (Ecf) Special Education School 40.78082 ## 1951 115500 PS 32 Mini-School Special Education School 40.55443 ## 1984 91388 PS 17 Special Education School 40.83584 ## 1985 112920 Speacial Ed School P.S 721 Special Education School 40.73577 ## 2095 88964 PS 179 Special Education School 40.74175 ## 2168 9492 PS 40 Special Education School 40.64093 ## 2181 116384 Special Education School Special Education School 40.74741 ## 2202 163841 PS 396 Special Education School 40.64895 ## longitude lon lat ## 15 -73.88380 NA NA ## 115 -74.23694 NA NA ## 187 -73.97922 NA NA ## 333 -73.78733 NA NA ## 340 -73.98591 NA NA ## 411 -73.72870 NA NA ## 561 -73.97669 NA NA ## 723 -73.98326 NA NA ## 817 -73.94522 NA NA ## 832 -73.84824 NA NA ## 852 -74.00530 NA NA ## 1016 -73.89781 NA NA ## 1148 -73.96921 NA NA ## 1361 -74.15150 NA NA ## 1616 -73.91236 NA NA ## 1704 -73.98786 NA NA ## 1724 -73.83891 NA NA ## 1734 -73.99529 NA NA ## 1749 -73.90492 NA NA ## 1784 -73.97809 NA NA ## 1798 -73.95558 NA NA ## 1951 -74.14824 NA NA ## 1984 -73.88721 NA NA ## 1985 -73.86796 NA NA ## 2095 -73.77827 NA NA ## 2168 -74.09533 NA NA ## 2181 -73.99282 NA NA ## 2202 -73.95693 NA NA ## NULL The special education schools are for those who are with their disabilities. The special education school helps them to sustain/support themselves in the society. In NYC there are around 20 of these schools, but in NYC there are around 1 million people with disabilities, 20% of them are below 18, which means they are in the age of being educated. While NYC has provided enough public support in civil levels like public transportations, I urge special attention to education support for people with disabilities. 5.4 Student Diversity Satisfaction vs. Actual School Diversity One of the questions on our mind was whether or not the perception that students’ had of the diversity in their schools actually corresponded with the actual diversity of their schools. To get an sense of this relationship, we generated a scatterplot of the # of students in each school, faceted by demographic, against the % of the student body that was satisfied with the diversity. From this, we were able to see a general trend where an increased representation, through # of students, was correlated with an increased positive sentiment of the student body on the diversity. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Our Process 6.2 Our Solution", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Our Process When working with the data, one of the questions that arose in our minds was whether or not the perception students’ had on the diversity of their own schools was grounded in reality. Upon investigating this question, we noticed that generally, as demographic representation rose across schools, so did the students’ satisfaction with their school’s diversity. We noticed a limitation of our visualization where the individual identity of the schools was lost. This graph also made it difficult to actually compare the relative proportions of each school, since we weren’t able to track schools across the different facets. We figured that a great way to see how the proportions change as student diversity sentiment increases would be to create an animation of sorts, a lot like this, where we could easily get a general sense of changing proportions across the dataset. Unfortunately, after much time trying to get the modules of Observable working locally, as well as some failed attempts on the Observable platform itself, we decided to code something on our own in D3 that would hopefully be as similar to the Observable notebook as possible. 6.2 Our Solution Hosted on VizHub In the end we implemented something that we believe is just as good if not better than the original linked Observable notebook. Implemented with D3 and some JQuery, we were able to implement a slider that allows us to scroll through schools from the lowest diversity sentiment to the highest. This updates a bar graph below the slider, that shows the actual diversity breakdown of the given school. We actually think that this solution is better than the bar chart race since the static positions of the bars gives us a stronger ability to actually track how the demographics are changing and is also much less distracting. We were also able to have a vertical bar chart instead of the horizontal one from the notebook, which also facilitates quick comparisons of the demographic breakdowns. As we suspected, by creating and analyzing this dynamic visualization we’ve been able to get a visual sense that, generally, as the proportion of various demographics begin to equalize, there is an increased positive sentiment from students toward diversity. This is indicative of there not being much of a discrepancy between the experienced diversity of students and the actual diversity at these schools, however we cannot make a strong conclusion without a proper follow up study. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Lessons learned 7.2 Limitations", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Lessons learned The research and data investigation process of this project provided insightful conclusions. From the datasets, we have seen the strong and constant funding support from NYC government to elementary public schools and middle schools. The widely distributed public school system is what ensures the education equity of the New York people. From the rivalry between charter schools and the public schools in high school institution level, we suggest that the public high school in New York might need more support from the government side. The intermediate schools, aiming for students in Grade 7-8, have become a popular option for NYC parents after the graduation of their kids from a 6-year education after Grade 6, surprisingly to us. The number of intermediate schools are almost the same as both of its counterpart and substitutional options combined: K-8, K-12 schools. From the datasets, we also investigated the vocational schools and the special education schools, these 2 categories of education institution are important for families in low income status. In our research, there are less than 30 vocational schools in total and around 20 special education schools in NYC. There could be more schools for the people in these 2 groups. By revealing and visualizing these data on the map, we also would like to use this project to advocate for people with their disabilities and from families without financial support for education. With respect to the discrepancies between the experienced diversity and the actual diversity across various NYC high schools, we seem to have discovered little to no evidence for a huge difference. From our precursory exploration of the data, scatterplots, and dynamic visualizations, we were able to get a sense that the lived experience of students was perfectly in line with the diversity of their schools. However, as a result of some of the aforementioned limitations in our data and methods, more work would need to be done before making any definitive conclusions! 7.2 Limitations There are several limitations that we have identified during the research. From the data collection perspective. The collection of census data has not included educational related variables except the college degree statistics. As researchers, we have to manually join the datasets tables and conduct laborious processes of data cleansing. If the data collection techniques could be improved to cover educational details based on school located in tracts (from when the raw data are collected), it will make our research more convenient. However, as we understand the scale of NYC census datasets has its own limitations, we still try to diminish the limitation brought from the original raw data to its minimum influence. With respect to our diversity data and methods, a stronger study might’ve perhaps included an increased granularity on the sentiment of the students on diversity. As of right now it was purely a binary sentiment and having levels would allow for stronger associations to be made. Similarly increased granularity in the demographic breakdowns of the schools would make for a much stronger study, as there was only 5 different categories without even accommodating for overlap. Among the datasets that were both published by the DOE were even inconsistencies, such as in the number of students recorded, as discussed in the data cleaning process. The drawback of such census data or government issued survey data is that unlike private entities that have the ability to acquire their user data, governmental surveys cannot enforce respondents’ answers. Demographical data in that sense are more complete than other reported statistics such as graduation rates or college rates, students’ satisfaction, etc. To deal with such inconsistencies, we selected the values based on its completeness and recalculated other values based on that population data.
