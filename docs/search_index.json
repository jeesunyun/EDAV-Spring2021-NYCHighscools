Through this analysis, we hope to answer the following questions: How do the demographics differ across different neighborhoods? How do the demographics differ in schools of different neighborhoods? Is there a difference from the neighborhoods demographics? Are there certain shared characteristics among schools? "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Dataset information 2.2 Problems with NYC datasets health and census data.", " Chapter 2 Data sources We used data sets listed in NYC Open Data and from NYC health department. Since we are exploring education data, most of the data are provided by the Department of Education. Below are the lists of datasets that we utilized. Doing joins of these data by school names, we will be able to get a comprehensive look at highschools and neighborhoods. 2019-20 Demographic Snapshot (DOE) This gives us the demographics of all NYC schools. 2019 High school Directory (DOE) 2020 High school Directory (DOE) This helps us to understand the characteristics of each of the NYC high schools (whether they are zoned, specialized, program descriptions, etc.) Below are some references we took into account for this project. nycgeo package documentation EDA and Models with NYC Census Data The data collection work is completed in basis of an group effort of 3 to ensure the integrity and the accountability of the data we use. The datasets are downloaded from official governmental or government-related organizations. The main datasets we use came from NYC Open Data that stores all New York related datasets. It is one of the NYC.gov sites which is maintained officially through New York City government. All datasets from NYC governmental background follow a certain pattern: they have a series of certain columns with identification information including NTA codes(Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA)), tracks ids, etc. The arrangements of these columns also have a hierarchical structure: starting from bits of tracts to all of the 5 boroughs. These structural datasets greatly benefited our project. NTA codes column in many of these datasets means that we can join different datasets together and conduct the combined research towards of topics. Its relation with GIS spatial information also assisted our visualization part. Thus with the completion of our project, we would like to thank NYC government who did all of these dedicated work and share them for education and public policy making purposes. 2.1 Dataset information The examples of the datasets are provided below, displayed using the head function. ## # A tibble: 6 x 39 ## DBN `School Name` Year `Total Enrollme… `Grade 3K+PK (H… `Grade K` ## &lt;chr&gt;

Some common and important columns are NTA codes, tracts ids, Race &amp; Ethnicities, Income and Child Poverty. NTA codes are GIS information for geographic marks and locations in NYC. Every single NTA code will match a place mark. 2.2 Problems with NYC datasets health and census data. Data related to schools, such as graduation rate or performance data can be easily found to be not available, mainly because they are not mandatory to be reported. Also, a lot of the data are not quantitative, but include free text forms of descriptions, which are not easy to work with. Also, NYC datasets is not very easy to use and understand. The researchers must investigate and read the description on how to interpret the information inside the datasets like NTA codes, track ids, longitude and latitude. There are many N/As inside the datasets which indicated some degree of incomplete of the raw data collection. From a programming perspective, the NYC datasets are not very suitable for R: the packages to process GIS information and spatial data require the researcher to read those detailed docs for specific packages like nycgeo.

Then, create new columns that contain population counts for high school grades and non-highschool grades. Here, we set for high school to be from grades 9 to 12, according to New York city Department of Education description. It is given that students in their 8th grade apply to high schools. We assume that schools that have grades 6 to 12, or K to 12, etc. have continuing students. Also, the dataset consists of information ranging from school years 2015 to 2019. We want to filter out years other than 2019 for initial processing of the data since the directory data are for 2019-2020. ## # A tibble: 6 x 41 ## DBN School_Name Year Total_Enrollment hs_enroll non_hs Grade_K Grade_1 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M2… Orchard Co… 2019… 226 226 0 0 0 ## 2 01M4… University… 2019… 492 492 0 0 0 ## 3 01M4… East Side … 2019… 680 364 316 0 0 ## 4 01M4… Forsyth Sa… 2019… 181 181 0 0 0 ## 5 01M5… Marta Vall… 2019… 97 97 0 0 0 ## 6 01M5… Lower East… 2019… 531 531 0 0 0 ## # … with 33 more variables: Grade_2 &lt;dbl&gt;, Grade_3 &lt;dbl&gt;, Grade_4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Grade_5 &lt;dbl&gt;, Grade_6 &lt;dbl&gt;, Grade_7 &lt;dbl&gt;, Grade_8 &lt;dbl&gt;, Grade_9 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # Grade_10 &lt;dbl&gt;, Grade_11 &lt;dbl&gt;, Grade_12 &lt;dbl&gt;, n_Female &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pct_Female &lt;dbl&gt;, n_Male &lt;dbl&gt;, pct_Male &lt;dbl&gt;, n_Asian &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pct_Asian &lt;dbl&gt;, n_Black &lt;dbl&gt;, pct_Black &lt;dbl&gt;, n_Hispanic &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pct_Hispanic &lt;dbl&gt;, n_Multiple_Race_Categories_Not_Represented &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pct_Multiple_Race_Categories_Not_Represented &lt;dbl&gt;, n_White &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pct_White &lt;dbl&gt;, n_Students_with_Disabilities &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pct_Students_with_Disabilities &lt;dbl&gt;, n_English_Language_Learners &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # pct_English_Language_Learners &lt;dbl&gt;, n_Poverty &lt;chr&gt;, pct_Poverty &lt;chr&gt;, ## # Economic_Need_Index &lt;chr&gt;, PK &lt;dbl&gt; 3.0.2 High school directory data ## [1] 427 462 The directory data has very extensive information each schools, from basic school information to detailed descriptions of each program and admission information.

The pattern is still difficult to observe becasue of the vast number of observations. Thus, let’s try to look at this by grouping them by borough. ## # A tibble: 5 x 4 ## Borough num_schools num_na percent_na ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 BROOKLYN 119 305 2.56 ## 2 BRONX 110 252 2.29 ## 3 MANHATTAN 107 244 2.28 ## 4 QUEENS 80 174 2.17 ## 5 STATEN IS 11 22 2 The data provided are mostly character data, not numerical scores to compare against.

"],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Select one (or more) of your key findings to present in an interactive or animated format using D3 version 6. Be thoughtful about how you use interactivity and/or animation: using these features to add value in a way that would not be possible with a static graph. Design with the goal of users walking away with a new understanding of the data and a clear understanding of the purpose of the visualization. If the tool is interactive, provide clear instructions on how the user should engage. Thoughtfulness is more important than technical prowess; in all aspects of the project, think quality, not quantity. Interactive graphs must follow all of the best practices as with static graphs in terms of perception, labeling, accuracy, etc. Please see this chapter on sharing your D3 code online (Links to an external site.) for options for sharing the interactive portion of your project. You are encouraged to share experiences on Piazza (Links to an external site.) to help classmates with the publishing process. Note: the interactive component is worth approximately 25% of the final project grade. Therefore, do not spend 90% of your time on it… concentrate on the exploratory data analysis piece.
