Through this analysis, we hope to answer the following questions: What does the distribution of schools look like in a map? In terms of number of schools and students; different types of schools,etc. How do the demographics differ across different schools? How do the demographics differ in schools of different neighborhoods? How are schools among different boroughs distinct in terms of variety of programs/courses available?

Since we are exploring education data, most of the data are provided by the Department of Education. Below are the lists of datasets that we utilized. Doing joins of these data by school names, we will be able to get a comprehensive look at highschools and neighborhoods. 2019-20 Demographic Snapshot (DOE) This gives us the demographics of all NYC schools. 2019 High school Directory (DOE) 2020 High school Directory (DOE) This helps us to understand the characteristics of each of the NYC high schools (whether they are zoned, specialized, program descriptions, etc.) Below are some references we took into account for this project. nycgeo package documentation EDA and Models with NYC Census Data The data collection work is completed in basis of an group effort of 3 to ensure the integrity and the accountability of the data we use. The datasets are downloaded from official governmental or government-related organizations. The main datasets we use came from NYC Open Data that stores all New York related datasets. It is one of the NYC.gov sites which is maintained officially through New York City government. 2.1 Dataset information The examples of the datasets are provided below, displayed using the head() function. The pieces of datasets presented in this project do not project the entire dataset, but are mostly the first 5-6 rows, and 5 columns due to vast numbers of columns. 2.1.1 School demographics and high school directory data ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## DBN `School Name` Year `Total Enrollmen… `Grade 3K+PK (Half Day &amp; … ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2015-… 176 14 ## 2 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2016-… 178 17 ## 3 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2017-… 190 17 ## 4 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2018-… 174 13 ## 5 01M015 P.S. 015 Roberto C… 2019-… 190 14 ## 6 01M019 P.S. 019 Asher Levy 2015-… 270 21 ## [1] &quot;This dataframe of high school demographics data included 9096 rows of info and 39 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;The total number of missing data is 0 0 % of the total.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Below are the first 6 columns names of the data, this includes the categories of the datas recorded:&quot; ## [1] &quot;DBN&quot; &quot;School Name&quot; ## [3] &quot;Year&quot; &quot;Total Enrollment&quot; ## [5] &quot;Grade 3K+PK (Half Day &amp; Full Day)&quot; &quot;Grade K&quot; ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## dbn school_name boro overview_paragraph school_10th_sea… ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 16K498 Brooklyn High Schoo… K The mission of Brooklyn Hi… Y ## 2 17K524 International High … K We are a small school that… Y ## 3 02M531 Repertory Company H… M We offer a college-prepara… Y ## 4 05M670 Thurgood Marshall A… M Thurgood Marshall Academy … Y ## 5 15K423 Brooklyn Frontiers … K Brooklyn Frontiers High Sc… &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 03M291 West End Secondary … M We promote and support sch… &lt;NA&gt; ## [1] &quot;This dataframe of high school demographics data included 427 rows of info and 462 columns.&quot; ## [1] &quot;The total number of missing data is 160305 , 81.26 % of the total.&quot; ## [1] &quot;Below are the first 6 columns names of the data, this includes the categories of the datas recorded:&quot; ## [1] &quot;dbn&quot; &quot;school_name&quot; &quot;boro&quot; ## [4] &quot;overview_paragraph&quot; &quot;school_10th_seats&quot; &quot;academicopportunities1&quot; The demographics data includes data related to grades, race and ethnicity, disabilities, and economic status.

NTA codes are GIS information for geographic marks and locations in NYC. Every single NTA code will match a place mark. All datasets from NYC governmental background follow a certain pattern: they have a series of certain columns with identification information including NTA codes(Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTA)), tracks ids, etc. The arrangements of these columns also have a hierarchical structure: starting from bits of tracts to all of the 5 boroughs. These structural datasets greatly benefited our project. NTA codes column in many of these datasets means that we can join different datasets together and conduct the combined research towards of topics. Its relation with GIS spatial information also assisted our visualization part. Thus with the completion of our project, we would like to thank NYC government who did all of these dedicated work and share them for education and public policy making purposes. For some information like Census codes, the R uses incorrect scientific notation, so we got rid of it. ## # A tibble: 2,167 x 5 ## CensusTract County Borough TotalPop Men ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 36005000100 Bronx Bronx 7703 7133 ## 2 36005000200 Bronx Bronx 5403 2659 ## 3 36005000400 Bronx Bronx 5915 2896 ## 4 36005001600 Bronx Bronx 5879 2558 ## 5 36005001900 Bronx Bronx 2591 1206 ## 6 36005002000 Bronx Bronx 8516 3301 ## 7 36005002300 Bronx Bronx 4774 2130 ## 8 36005002400 Bronx Bronx 150 109 ## 9 36005002500 Bronx Bronx 5355 2338 ## 10 36005002701 Bronx Bronx 3016 1375 ## # … with 2,157 more rows 2.2 Problems with NYC datasets health and census data. Data related to schools, such as graduation rate or performance data can be easily found to be not available, mainly because they are not mandatory to be reported. Also, a lot of the data are not quantitative, but include free text forms of descriptions, which are not easy to work with. Also, NYC datasets is not very easy to use and understand. The researchers must investigate and read the description on how to interpret the information inside the datasets like NTA codes, track ids, longitude and latitude. There are many N/As inside the datasets which indicated some degree of incomplete of the raw data collection. From a programming perspective, the NYC datasets are not very suitable for R: the packages to process GIS information and spatial data require the researcher to read those detailed docs for specific packages like nycgeo.

Then, create new columns that contain population counts for high school grades and non-highschool grades. Here, we set for high school to be from grades 9 to 12, according to New York city Department of Education description. It is given that students in their 8th grade apply to high schools. We assume that schools that have grades 6 to 12, or K to 12, etc. have continuing students. Also, the dataset consists of information ranging from school years 2015 to 2019. We want to filter out years other than 2019 for initial processing of the data since the directory data are for 2019-2020. Moreover, we created new columns hs_enroll and non_hs to divide population that are in grades 9 to 12 to others. ## # A tibble: 6 x 5 ## DBN School_Name Year Total_Enrollment hs_enroll ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 01M292 Orchard Collegiate Academy 2019-… 226 226 ## 2 01M448 University Neighborhood High School 2019-… 492 492 ## 3 01M450 East Side Community School 2019-… 680 364 ## 4 01M458 Forsyth Satellite Academy 2019-… 181 181 ## 5 01M509 Marta Valle High School 2019-… 97 97 ## 6 01M515 Lower East Side Preparatory High Sch… 2019-… 531 531 3.1.2 High school directory data Dimension of the directory data: ## [1] 427 462 The directory data has very extensive information each schools, from basic school information to detailed descriptions of each program and admission information.

Number of observations with different reported population: ## [1] 420 66 Number of observations with identical reported population: ## [1] 5 66 Only 5 schools have total number of students identical in both data sets. Investigating the data, we see that there are population data missing for 2 schools from the Demographics dataset. Column Total_Enrollment comes from Demographics data, and total_students come from Directory data.

We can see that these two schools share that they do not serve grades until 12th grade. According to the aforementioned NYC high school description (grade 9 to 12), we can filter out these schools. Also, since the demographic data are from the Demographics dataset, we recalculate the other values into proportion with the demographics total population. Take out the total_students column and the School_Name column, since two dataframes were joined by dbn and the school names are written differently.

For example, some schools might have 10 different programs, offered, while others may have only 1.

NYC Census Data Examples - NYC residents College degree census To confirm that the map boundary that we created above works, we implemented an example map that shows the percentage of people that has a Bachelor’s degree and aboce in NYC. We can see that the area that has the most university graduates are in Manhattan, especially up to what appears to be Morningside Heights, and in Brooklym close to Manhattan. 5.2 Explore characteristics shared by schools Grades in schools ## ## 6 to 12 7 to 12 9 to 12 9 to 14 K to 12 ## [1,] 74 1 335 7 4 ## ## School is structured on credit needs, not grade level ## [1,] 4 The table shows that schools are mostly from grades 9 to 12, and 6 to 12. We want to see characteristics of these schools, especially in what classes and diploa are offered. We separate the columns of such columns by &quot;,&quot; since they are currently in a free text form and change them to categories. 5.2.1 Courses and Programs Available language classes according to borough The order of language classes in the x-axis are ordered by their total frequency. Thus, Spanish is the most taught foreign language in high schools, followed by French, Italian, and Mandarin. However, it is difficult to see in the above graph which borough offers the most language classes, so we create a treemap to observe. AP courses available by borough The order of the x-axis shows the most offered AP courses, insinuating a certain popularity of such AP courses in high schools. In accordance to the language courses, Staten Island has the least schools and thus the least variety of courses offered. 5.2.2 Demographics Demographics of high school students in New York in a whole Population of students and number of schools per neighborhood Largely, the number of students that go to school in a certain area seem sto be in proportion to the number of schools in the corresponding neighborhood. However, in certain neighborhood in Queens and in Lower Manhattan seems to have outliers, where there are more students than surrounding neighborhoods that have more schools. So, we would like to see how many schools there are per 100 students. Here in this graph, the higher the ratio would indicate that there are more schools per number of students, where as the darker areas indicate that there are fewer schools per students than other neighborhoods. Student demographics by borough Although the number of students per borough are significantly different, it is suaprising that the proportion of students of a certain race among big boroughs like Brooklyn and Manhattan are similar. 5.3 Different Categories of schools in NYC Find all categories of the schools in NYC. ## [1] &quot;Charter School&quot; ## [2] &quot;Elementary School&quot; ## [3] &quot;Intermediate School&quot; ## [4] &quot;Academic High School&quot; ## [5] &quot;High school - Public&quot; ## [6] &quot;Special Education School&quot; ## [7] &quot;Junior High-Intermediate-Middle School - Public&quot; ## [8] &quot;Elementary School - Public&quot; ## [9] &quot;K-8 School - Charter&quot; ## [10] &quot;K-8 School - Public&quot; ## [11] &quot;Secondary School - Public&quot; ## [12] &quot;Elementary School - Charter&quot; ## [13] &quot;K-12 all grades School - Charter&quot; ## [14] &quot;Junior High-Intermediate-Middle School - Charter&quot; ## [15] &quot;High school - Charter&quot; ## [16] &quot;K-12 all grades School - Public&quot; ## [17] &quot;School&quot; ## [18] &quot;Secondary School - Charter&quot; ## [19] &quot;Vocational High School&quot; ## [20] &quot;Educational Skills Center&quot; ## [21] &quot;Alternative High School&quot; ## [22] &quot;Public School&quot; This does not only limit to highschools, but is an overview of all different categories of schooling in NYC. As seen previously in the data cleaning process, high schools are not strictly from grades 9 to 12 but there are also schools from grade 6 to 12, or K to 12(all grades) schools. Thus, it would be inefficient and ineffective to plot something like below, only showing for highschools: 5.3.1 Geo-spatitial Interactive Map of NYC school datasets 5.3.2 Maps high schools 5.3.3 Graph of the vocational high school ## NULL 5.3.4 Intermediate schools ## NULL 5.3.5 Special education school mapping ## uid facname factype latitude ## 15 8671 PS 34 Special Education School 40.85028 ## 115 22605 PS 25 &amp; PS 4 Portable Special Education School 40.53969 ## 187 136781 PS 148 Special Education School 40.78633 ## 333 47522 PS 177 &amp; Playground Special Education School 40.74327 ## 340 167497 PS 58 Special Education School 40.76416 ## 411 124528 PS 811 (Old PS 187-Cmhc)&amp;Plygd Special Education School 40.75646 ## 561 87078 PS 77 Special Education School 40.67873 ## 723 193182 PS 369 Special Education School 40.68733 ## 817 75115 PS 148 Special Education School 40.69925 ## 832 83564 Special Education School Special Education School 40.81658 ## 852 122213 PS 371 Special Education School 40.65417 ## 1016 164809 PS 186 Special Education School 40.83140 ## 1148 86898 PS 753 (Old Sterling HS) Special Education School 40.68263 ## 1361 115499 IS 24 Annex Special Education School 40.56403 ## 1616 97115 PS 9 (Old PS 86) Special Education School 40.71831 ## 1704 119297 PS 751 (Old PS 25) Special Education School 40.72572 ## 1724 149828 PS 721 Ax Otc Special Education School 40.84273 ## 1734 122158 PS 226-Special Education Special Education School 40.73477 ## 1749 69845 PS 75 Special Education School 40.69865 ## 1784 122535 Jhs 47 Annex Special Education School 40.73700 ## 1798 136789 PS 169 (Ecf) Special Education School 40.78082 ## 1951 115500 PS 32 Mini-School Special Education School 40.55443 ## 1984 91388 PS 17 Special Education School 40.83584 ## 1985 112920 Speacial Ed School P.S 721 Special Education School 40.73577 ## 2095 88964 PS 179 Special Education School 40.74175 ## 2168 9492 PS 40 Special Education School 40.64093 ## 2181 116384 Special Education School Special Education School 40.74741 ## 2202 163841 PS 396 Special Education School 40.64895 ## longitude lon lat ## 15 -73.88380 NA NA ## 115 -74.23694 NA NA ## 187 -73.97922 NA NA ## 333 -73.78733 NA NA ## 340 -73.98591 NA NA ## 411 -73.72870 NA NA ## 561 -73.97669 NA NA ## 723 -73.98326 NA NA ## 817 -73.94522 NA NA ## 832 -73.84824 NA NA ## 852 -74.00530 NA NA ## 1016 -73.89781 NA NA ## 1148 -73.96921 NA NA ## 1361 -74.15150 NA NA ## 1616 -73.91236 NA NA ## 1704 -73.98786 NA NA ## 1724 -73.83891 NA NA ## 1734 -73.99529 NA NA ## 1749 -73.90492 NA NA ## 1784 -73.97809 NA NA ## 1798 -73.95558 NA NA ## 1951 -74.14824 NA NA ## 1984 -73.88721 NA NA ## 1985 -73.86796 NA NA ## 2095 -73.77827 NA NA ## 2168 -74.09533 NA NA ## 2181 -73.99282 NA NA ## 2202 -73.95693 NA NA ## NULL "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component Select one (or more) of your key findings to present in an interactive or animated format using D3 version 6. Be thoughtful about how you use interactivity and/or animation: using these features to add value in a way that would not be possible with a static graph. Design with the goal of users walking away with a new understanding of the data and a clear understanding of the purpose of the visualization. If the tool is interactive, provide clear instructions on how the user should engage. Thoughtfulness is more important than technical prowess; in all aspects of the project, think quality, not quantity. Interactive graphs must follow all of the best practices as with static graphs in terms of perception, labeling, accuracy, etc. Please see this chapter on sharing your D3 code online (Links to an external site.) for options for sharing the interactive portion of your project. You are encouraged to share experiences on Piazza (Links to an external site.) to help classmates with the publishing process. Note: the interactive component is worth approximately 25% of the final project grade. Therefore, do not spend 90% of your time on it… concentrate on the exploratory data analysis piece.
