<p>We can see that the data contains data not only for high school, and for school years other than 2019.
The column names are difficult to retract due to spaces and special characters, so we rename columns that is easier to retract.</p>

<p>We don’t want schools that are not high schools; the grade range is different per school, so we filter out schools that do not have grades 10, 11, and 12. Then, create new columns that contain population counts for high school grades and non-highschool grades.
Here, we set for high school to be from grades 9 to 12, according to <a href="https://www.schools.nyc.gov/enrollment/enroll-grade-by-grade/high-school">New York city Department of Education description</a>. It is given that students in their 8th grade apply to high schools. We assume that schools that have grades 6 to 12, or K to 12, etc. have continuing students.</p>
<p>Also, the dataset consists of information ranging from school years 2015 to 2019. We want to filter out years other than 2019 for initial processing of the data since the directory data are for 2019-2020.</p>

<p>We can see that these two schools share that they do not serve grades until 12th grade.
According to aforementioned NYC high school description (grade 9 to 12), we can filter out these schools.
Also, since the demographic data are from the Demographics dataset, we recalculate the other values into proportion with the demographics total population.</p>
