# Data sources


We used data sets listed in [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/).
Since we are exploring education data, most of the data are provided by the Department of Education.

Below are the lists of datasets that we utilized.
Doing joins of these data by school names, we will be able to get a comprehensive look at highschools and neighborhoods.

1. [2019-20 Demographic Snapshot (DOE)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-20-Demographic-Snapshot-School/nie4-bv6q)
  * This gives us the demographics of all NYC schools.

2. [2019 High school Directory (DOE)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2019-DOE-High-School-Directory/uq7m-95z8)
   [2020 High school Directory (DOE)](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Education/2020-DOE-High-School-Directory/23z9-6uk9)
  * This helps us to understand the characteristics of each of the NYC high schools (whether they are zoned, specialized, program descriptions, etc.)
